## About the Startpage

To use this startpage for Firefox,

1. Install Firefox extension New Tab Override
2. Go to your addons page, and go to the options page of New Tab Override
3. Set https://chenxing.io as new tab url

The website is mainly built with [Astro](https://astro.build/) with [React](https://react.dev/) and [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) components. The art style is inspired by the popular status bar [Polybar](https://github.com/polybar/polybar) and the terminal file manager [lf](https://github.com/gokcehan/lf). It uses [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling, [Tailwind Typography](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-typography) for typography, [Motion](https://motion.dev) and [TypeIt](https://www.typeitjs.com/) for animations.
